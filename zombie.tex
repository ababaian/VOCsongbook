\beginsong{Zombie}[by={The Cranberries}]
\beginverse*
\[Em] Another \[C]head hangs lowly,
\[G]Child is slowly \[D]taken.
\[Em] The violence \[C]caused such silence.
\[G]Who are we mis\[D]taken?
\endverse
\beginverse*
But you \[Em]see, it's not me, it's not \[C]my family.
In your \[G]head, in your head they are \[D]fighting,
With their \[Em]tanks and their bombs,
And their \[C]bombs and their guns.
In your \[G]head, in your head, they are \[D]crying...
\endverse
\beginchorus
In your \[Em]head, in your \[C]head,
Zom\[G]bie, zombie, zom\[D]bie, hey, hey,
What's in your \[Em]head, in your \[C]head,
Zom\[G]bie, zombie, zom\[D]bie, hey, hey hey...
\endchorus
\beginverse*
\[Em] Another \[C]mother's breakin'
\[G]Heart is taking \[D]over
\[Em] When the violence \[C]causes silence,
\[G]We must be mis\[D]taken.
\endverse
\beginverse*
It's the \[Em]same old theme since \[C]nineteen-sixteen.
In your \[G]head, in your head they're still \[D]fighting,
With their \[Em]tanks and their bombs,
And their \[C]bombs and their guns.
In your \[G]head, in your head, they are \[D]dying...
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
(hey, hey, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh, ya, ya-aâ€¦)
