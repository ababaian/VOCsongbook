\beginsong{Zombie}[by={The Cranberries}]
\beginverse
\[Em] Another \[C]head hangs lowly, \[G]child is slowly \[D]taken
\[Em] And the violence \[C]caused such silence
\[G]Who are we mis\[D]taken?
\endverse
\beginverse
But you \[Em]see, it's not me, it's not \[C]my family
In your \[G]head, in your head they are \[D]fighting
With their \[Em]tanks and their bombs, and their \[C]bombs and their guns
In your \[G]head, in your head, they are \[D]crying...
\endverse
\beginchorus
In your \[Em]head, in your \[C]head,
Zom\[G]bie, zombie, zom\[D]bie, hey, hey,
What's in your \[Em]head, in your \[C]head,
Zom\[G]bie, zombie, zom\[D]bie, hey, hey, hey, oh...
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Em] Another \[C]mother's breakin', \[G]heart is taking \[D]over
\[Em] When the violence \[C]causes silence, \[G]we must be mis\[D]taken
\endverse
\beginverse
It's the \[Em]same old theme since \[C]nineteen-sixteen
In your \[G]head, in your head they're still \[D]fighting
With their \[Em]tanks and their bombs, and their \[C]bombs and their guns
In your \[G]head, in your head, they are \[D]dying...
\endverse
