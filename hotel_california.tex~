\beginsong{Hotel California}[by={The Eagles}]
\beginverse*
\[Bm]On a dark desert highway, \[F#]cool wind in my hair
\[A]Warm smell of colitas, \[E]rising up through the air
\[G]Up ahead in the distance, \[D/F#]I saw a shimmering light
\[Em]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
\[F#]I had to stop for the night

\[Bm]There she stood in the doorway;
\[F#]I heard the mission bell
\[A]And I was thinking to myself,
\[E]'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
\[G]Then she lit up a candle and \[D/F#]she showed me the way
\[Em]There were voices down the corridor,
\[F#]I thought I heard them say...
\endverse
\beginchorus
\textnote{Strum a few D/F\#'s after California}
\[G]Welcome to the Hotel \[D/F#]California
\[F#]Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
\[Bm]Such a lovely face (such a lovely place)
\[G]Plenty of room at the Hotel \[D/F#]California
\[Em]Any time of year (any time of year)
\[F#]You can find it here
\endchorus
\beginverse*
Her mind is TiffanyÂ­twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty
nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
\endverse
\beginchorus\singlespacing
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face (such a lovely face)
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis (bring your alibis)
\endchorus
\beginverse\singlespacing
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'Relax,' said the night man,
We are programmed to receive.
You can checkout any time you like,
but you can never leave
\endverse
