\beginchorus
And I \[Bm]need you now to\[C]night
And I \[D]need you more than \[G]ever
And if you [Bm]only hold me \[C]tight
We'll be \[D]holding on for\[G]ever
And we'll \[Bm]only be making it \[C]right
'Cause we'll \[D]never be wrong 
\[C]Together we can take it to the \[D]end of the line
Your \[Em]love is like a shadow on me \[A]all of the time (all of the time)
I \[G]don't know what to do, I'm \[D]always in the dark
We're \[Em]living in a powder keg and \[A]giving off sparks
I really need you to\[G]night
For\[Bm]ever's gonna start to\[C]night
For\[D]ever's gonna start to(night)
\[G]Once upon a time I was \[Em]falling in love
But \[Bm]now I'm only falling a\[C]part
There's \[Am]nothing I can do
A \[D]total eclipse of the \[G]heart \[Bm] \[C] \[D]
\[G]Once upon a time there was \[Em]light in my life
But \[Bm]now there's only love in the \[C]dark
\[Am]Nothing I can say
A \[D]total eclipse of the \[G]heart
