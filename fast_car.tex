^You got a fast ^car
^I got a plan to ^get us out of here
^I been working at the ^convenience store
^Managed to save just a ^little bit of money
^Won't have to drive too ^far
^Just 'cross the border and ^into the city
^You and I can ^both get jobs
And ^finally see what it ^means to be living

^Leave tonight or live and ^die this way

\beginverse*
\[D]Remember when we were \[C]driving, driving in your car
\[G]Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
\[Em]City lights lay out before us
And your \[D]arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And \[C]I-I had a \[G]feeling that \[D]I belonged
\[C]I-I had a \[G]feeling I could \[D]be someone, \[C]be someone, \[D]be someone

^You got a fast ^car
^We go cruising, enter^tain ourselves
^Still ain't got a ^job
And I ^work in a market as a ^checkout girl
^I know things will get ^better
^You'll find work and ^I'll get promoted
^We'll move out of the ^shelter
^Buy a bigger house and ^live in the suburbs
