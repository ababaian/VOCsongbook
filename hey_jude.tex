\beginsong{Hey Jude}[by={The Beatles}]
\beginverse\memorize
\[G] Where it began, \[C] I can't begin to knowin'
\[G] But then I know it's growing \[D]strong
\[G] Was in the spring? And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along.

Hands, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would (but now I...)

Look at the night, and it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two.
And when I hurt, hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holding you?

Warm, touchin' warm
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined,
To believe they never would (oh, no, no...) 

Repeat Chorus
(Sweet Caroline...)
