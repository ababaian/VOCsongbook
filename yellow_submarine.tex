\beginsong{Yellow submarine}[by={The Beatles}]

\beginverse\memorize
In the \[D]town where I was \[G]born, lived a \[Am]man who sailed to \[D]sea
And he \[D]told us of his \[G]life, in the \[Am]land of submar\[D]ines
\endverse

\beginverse
So we ^sailed on to the ^sun, till we ^found a sea of ^green
And we ^lived beneath the ^waves, in our ^yellow submar^ine
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]We all live in a \[D]yellow submarine,
\[D]Yellow submarine, \[G]yellow submarine.
\[G]We all live in a \[D]yellow submarine,
\[D]Yellow submarine, \[G]yellow submarine.
\endchorus

\beginverse
And our ^friends are all ^aboard, many ^more of them live next ^door
And the ^band begins to ^play... ^  ^ {\nolyrics (Horn Part)}
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]We all live in a \[D]yellow submarine,
\[D]Yellow submarine, \[G]yellow submarine.
\[G]We all live in a \[D]yellow submarine,
\[D]Yellow submarine, \[G]yellow submarine.
\endchorus

\beginverse
As we \[D]live a life of \[G]ease (life of ease)
Every \[Am]one of us (Every one of us) has all we \[D]need (has all we need)
Sky of \[D]blue (Sky of blue) and sea of \[G]green (sea of green)
In our \[Am]yellow (In our yellow) submar\[D]ine (submarine, aha)
\endverse
