\beginsong{Wish you were here}[by={Pink Floyd}]
\beginverse
\[C] So, so you think you can \[D]tell 
Heaven from \[Am]Hell
Blue skies from \[G]pain.
Can you tell a green \[D]field 
from a cold steel \[C]rail?
A smile from a \[Am]veil
Do you think you can \[G]tell?
Did they get you to \[C]trade 
Your heroes for \[D]ghosts
Hot ashes for \[Am]trees
Hot air for a \[G]cool breeze
Cold comfort for \[D]change
Did you ex\[C]change? 
A walk on part in the \[Am]war 
For a lead role in a \[G]cage
\endverse
\beginverse
\[C] How I wish, how I wish you were \[D]here
We're just \[Am]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
\[G] Year after year.
\endverse
\beginverse
\[D] Running over the same old ground.
\[C] What have we found?
The same old \[Am]fears
Wish you were \[G]here...
\endverse
