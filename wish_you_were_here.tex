\beginsong{Wish you were here}[by={Pink Floyd}]
\beginverse
\[C]So, so you think \[D]you can tell 
Heaven \[AM]from Hell
Blue skies \[G]from pain.
Can you tell a \[D] green field 
from a cold \[C] steel rail?
A smile \[AM]from a veil
Do you think \[G]you can tell?
Did they get \[C]you to trade 
Your heroes \[D] for ghosts
Hot ashes \[AM]for trees
Hot air for a \[G]cool breeze
Cold comfort \[D] for change
Did you \[C]exchange? 
A walk on part \[AM]in the war 
For a lead role \[G] in a cage
\endverse
\beginverse
\[C]How I wish, how I \[D]wish you were here
We're \[Am]just two lost souls swimming \[G] in a fish bowl
Year after \[D] year.
\endverse
\beginverse
Running over the same old ground.
\[C]What have we found?
\[AM]The same old fears
Wish you \[G]were here...
\endverse
