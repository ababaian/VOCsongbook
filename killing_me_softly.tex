\[Em]Strumming my pain with his \[Am]fingers
\[D]Singing my life with his \[G]words
\[Em]Killing me softly with \[A]his song

Telling my \[G]whole life with \[C]his words
Killing me \[Fmaj7]softly with his \[E]song
\endchorus

\[Am] I heard he \[D]sang a good song
\[G] I heard he \[Fmaj7]had a style

\[Am] And there he \[D]was this young boy
\[G] A stranger \[B7]to my eyes

\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse*
^ I felt all ^flushed with fever,
^ Embarrassed ^by the crowd
^ I felt he ^found my letters,
And ^read each one out loud
^ I prayed that ^he would finish,
^ But he just ^kept right on
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse*
^ He sang as ^if he knew me
^ In all my ^dark despair
^ And then he ^looked right through me
As ^if I wasn't there
^ And he just ^kept on singing
^ Singing ^clear and strong
