\[Am7] I heard he \[D]sang a good song

\[G] A stranger \[B7]to my eyes

\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
^ I felt all ^flushed with fever,
^ Embarrassed ^by the crowd
^ I felt he ^found my letters,
And ^read each one out ^loud
^ I prayed that ^he would finish,
^ But he just ^kept right on
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
^ He sang as ^if he knew me
^ In all my ^dark despair
^ And then he ^looked right through me
As ^if I wasn't ^there
^ And he just ^kept on singing
^ Singing ^clear and strong
\endverse
