\[G]Headed down south to the \[D]land of the pines
I'm \[Em]thumbin' my way into \[C]North Caroline

And \[D]pray to God I see \[C]headlights
\endverse
\beginverse
^I made it down the coast in ^seventeen hours
^Pickin' me a bouquet of ^dogwood flowers
And I'm a ^hopin' for Raleigh
I can ^see my baby ^tonight
\endverse
\beginchorus
So \[G]rock me mama like a \[D]wagon wheel
\[Em]Rock me mama \[C]anyway you feel
\[G-D]Hey    mama \[C]rock me

\beginverse
^Runnin' from the cold up in ^New England
I was ^born to be a fiddler in an ^old-time string band
^My baby plays the guitar
^I pick a banjo ^now
\endverse
\beginverse
Oh, the ^North country winters keep a ^ gettin' me now
^Lost my money playin' poker so I ^ had to up and leave
But I ^ain't a turnin' back
To ^livin' that old life no ^ more
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
^Walkin' due south out of ^Roanoke
caught a ^trucker out of Philly              
Had a ^nice long toke          
But he's a ^headed west from the ^Cumberland Gap          
To ^Johnson City, Tennessee
\endverse
\beginverse
And I ^gotta get a move on ^fit for the sun
I hear my ^baby callin' my name 
And I ^know that she's the only one
And ^if I die in Raleigh
At ^least I will die ^free
\endverse
