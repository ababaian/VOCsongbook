\endverse

^I made it down the coast in ^seventeen hours
^Pickin' me a bouquet of ^dogwood flowers
And I'm a ^hopin' for Raleigh. I can ^see my baby ^tonight
\endverse

\beginchorus
So \[G]rock me mama like a \[D]wagon wheel
\[Em]Rock me mama \[C]anyway you feel
\[G]Hey\[D].... mama \[C]rock me
\[G]Rock me mama like the \[D]wind and the rain
\[Em]Rock me mama like a \[C]south-bound train
\[G]Hey\[D].... mama \[C]rock me
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Runnin' from the cold up in ^New England
I was ^born to be a fiddler in an ^old-time string band
^My baby plays the guitar. ^I pick a banjo ^now
\endverse

Oh, the ^North country winters keep a ^ gettin' me now
^Lost my money playin' poker so I ^ had to leave town
But I ^ain't a turnin' back. To ^livin' that old life no ^ more

\beginverse
^Walkin' due south out of ^Roanoke
Caught a ^trucker out of Philly. Had a ^nice long toke 
But he's a ^headed west from the ^Cumberland Gap to ^Johnson City, Tennessee
\endverse
\beginverse
And I ^gotta get a move on ^fit for the sun
I hear my ^baby callin' my name. And I ^know that she's the only one
And ^if I die in Raleigh. At ^least I will die ^free
\endverse
