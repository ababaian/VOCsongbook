\beginsong{Barrett's Privateers}[by={Stan Rogers}]
\beginverse
Oh the \[C]year was Seventeen \[G]Seventy-\[C]Eight
How I wish I \[F]was in \[C]Sherbrooke \[G]now
A \[C]letter of \[G]marque came \[C]from the king
To the scummiest vessel I've \[G]ever \[F]seen
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G]God \[C]damn them all
I was \[F]told we'd \[C]cruise the \[F]seas for \[C]American \[F]gold
We'd \[G]fire no \[C]guns, \[G]shed no \[F]tears
Now I'm a \[C]broken \[F]man on a \[C]Halifax \[F]pier,
The last of Barrett's \[G]Privat\[C]eers
\endchorus
\beginverse
O ^Elcid Barrett ^cried the ^town
How I wish I ^was in ^Sherbrooke ^now
For ^twenty brave ^men all ^fishermen who
Would make for him the ^Antelope's ^crew
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
The ^Antelope sloop was a ^sickening ^site
How I wish I ^was in ^Sherbrooke ^now
She'd ^list to the ^port and her ^sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the ^staggers and ^jags
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
On the ^King's birthday we ^put to ^sea
How I wish I ^was in ^Sherbrooke ^now
^Ninety-one ^days to ^Montego Bay
Pumping like madmen ^all the ^way
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
On the ^ninety-sixth day we ^sailed ^again
How I wish I ^was in ^Sherbrooke ^now
When a ^great big ^Yankee ^hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we ^made to ^fight
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
The ^Yankee lay low ^down with ^gold
How I wish I ^was in ^Sherbrooke ^now
She was ^broad and ^fat and ^loose in stays
But to catch her took the Antelope ^two whole ^days
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
Then at ^length she stood two ^cables ^away
How I wish I ^was in ^Sherbrooke ^now
Our ^cracked four-^pounders made ^awful din
But with one fat ball the Yank ^stove us ^in
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
The ^Antelope shook and ^pitched on her ^side
How I wish I ^was in ^Sherbrooke ^now
^Barrett was ^smashed like a ^bowl of eggs
And the main truck carried off ^both me ^legs
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
Now ^here I lay in my ^twenty-third ^year
How I wish I ^was in ^Sherbrooke ^now
It's ^been six ^years since we ^sailed away
And I just made Halifax ^yester^day
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
