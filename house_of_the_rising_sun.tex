\beginverse*
My ^mother ^was a ^tailor ^
She ^sewed my ^new blue ^jeans ^
My ^father ^was a ^gamblin' ^man
^Down in ^New Orl^eans ^
\endverse
\beginverse*
Now the ^only ^thing a ^gambler ^needs
Is a ^suitcase ^and a ^trunk ^
And the ^only ^time he's ^satis^fied
Is ^when he's ^on a ^drunk ^
\endverse
\beginverse*
Oh ^mother ^tell your ^children ^
Not to ^do what ^I have ^done ^
^Spend your ^lives in ^sin and mise^ry
In the ^House of the ^Rising ^Sun ^
\endverse
\beginverse*
Well, I ^got one ^foot on the ^platform ^
The ^other ^foot on the ^train ^
I'm ^goin' ^back to ^New Or^leans
To ^wear that ^ball and ^chain ^
\endverse
