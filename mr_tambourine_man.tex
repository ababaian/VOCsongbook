\beginsong{Mr. Tambourine Man}[by={Bob Dylan}]
\beginchorus
\[C]Hey ! Mr \[D]Tambourine Man, \[G]play a song for \[C]me
I'm not \[G]sleepy and \[C]there is no place I'm \[D7]going to
\[C]Hey ! Mr \[D]Tambourine Man, \[G]play a song for \[C]me
In the \[G]jingle jangle \[C]morning I'll come \[D7]followin' \[G]you.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Though I \[C]know that evenin's \[D]empire has \[G]returned into \[C]sand
\[G]Vanished from my \[C]hand
Left me \[G]blindly here to \[C]stand but still not \[D]sleeping
My \[C]weariness \[D]amazes me, I'm \[G]branded on my \[C]feet
I \[G]have no one to \[C]meet
And the \[G]ancient empty \[C]street's too dead for \[D]dreaming.
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
\[C]Take me on a \[D]trip upon your \[G]magic swirlin' \[C]ship
My \[G]senses have been \[C]stripped, my \[G]hands can't feel to \[C]grip
My \[G]toes too numb to \[C]step, wait \[G]only for my \[C]boot heels
To be \[D]wanderin'
I'm \[C]ready to go \[D]anywhere, I'm \[G]ready for to \[C]fade
In\[G]to my own pa\[C]rade, cast your \[G]dancing spell my \[C]way
I promise to go \[D]under it.
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
Though you \[C]might hear laughin', \[D]spinnin' swingin' \[G]madly across the \[C]sun
It's not \[G]aimed at any\[C]one, it's just es\[G]capin' on the \[C]run
And but \[G]for the sky there \[C]are no fences \[D]facin'
And \[C]if you hear vague \[D]traces of \[G]skippin' reels of \[C]rhyme
To your \[G]tambourine in \[C]time, it's just a \[G]ragged clown be\[C]hind
I wouldn't \[G]pay it any \[C]mind, it's just a \[G]shadow you're
\[C]Seein' that he's \[D]chasing.
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
Then \[C]take me disap\[D]pearin' through the \[G]smoke rings of my \[C]mind
Down the \[G]foggy ruins of \[C]time, far \[G]past the frozen \[C]leaves
The \[G]haunted, frightened \[C]trees, out \[G]to the windy \[C]beach
Far \[G]from the twisted \[C]reach of crazy \[D]sorrow
Yes, to \[C]dance beneath the \[D]diamond sky with \[G]]one hand waving \[C]free
Silhou\[G]etted by the \[C]sea, circled \[G]by the circus \[C]sands
With all \[G]memory and \[C]fate driven \[G]deep beneath the \[C]waves
Let me for\[G]get about to\[C]day until to\[D]morrow.
\endverse
