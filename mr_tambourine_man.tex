\beginsong{Mr. Tambourine Man}[by={Bob Dylan}]
\beginchorus
\[F]Hey ! Mr \[G]Tambourine Man, \[C]play a song for \[F]me
I'm not \[C]sleepy and \[F]there is no place I'm \[G7]going to
\[F]Hey ! Mr \[G]Tambourine Man, \[C]play a song for \[F]me
In the \[C]jingle jangle \[F]morning I'll come \[G7]followin' \[C]you.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Though I \[F]know that evenin's \[G]empire has \[C]returned into \[F]sand
\[C]Vanished from my \[F]hand
Left me \[C]blindly here to \[F]stand but still not \[G]sleeping
My \[F]weariness \[G]amazes me, I'm \[C]branded on my \[F]feet
I \[C]have no one to \[F]meet
And the \[C]ancient empty \[F]street's too dead for \[G]dreaming.
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse
\[F]Take me on a \[G]trip upon your \[C]magic swirlin' \[F]ship
My \[C]senses have been \[F]stripped, my \[C]hands can't feel to \[F]grip
My \[C]toes too numb to \[F]step, wait \[C]only for my \[F]boot heels
To be \[G]wanderin'
I'm \[F]ready to go \[G]anywhere, I'm \[C]ready for to \[F]fade
In\[C]to my own pa\[F]rade, cast your \[C]dancing spell my \[F]way
I promise to go \[G]under it.
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse
Though you \[F]might hear laughin', \[G]spinnin' swingin' \[C]madly across the \[F]sun
It's not \[C]aimed at any\[F]one, it's just es\[C]capin' on the \[F]run
And but \[C]for the sky there \[F]are no fences \[G]facin'
And \[F]if you hear vague \[G]traces of \[C]skippin' reels of \[F]rhyme
To your \[C]tambourine in \[F]time, it's just a \[C]ragged clown be\[F]hind
I wouldn't \[C]pay it any \[F]mind, it's just a \[C]shadow you're
\[F]Seein' that he's \[G]chasing.
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse
Then \[F]take me disap\[G]pearin' through the \[C]smoke rings of my \[F]mind
Down the \[C]foggy ruins of \[F]time, far \[C]past the frozen \[F]leaves
The \[C]haunted, frightened \[F]trees, out \[C]to the windy \[F]beach
Far \[C]from the twisted \[F]reach of crazy \[G]sorrow
Yes, to \[F]dance beneath the \[G]diamond sky with \[C]one hand waving \[F]free
Silhou\[C]etted by the \[F]sea, circled \[C]by the circus \[F]sands
With all \[C]memory and \[F]fate driven \[C]deep beneath the \[F]waves
Let me for\[C]get about to\[F]day until to\[G]morrow.
\endverse
