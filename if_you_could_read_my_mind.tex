\beginsong{If you could read my mind}[by={Gordon Lightfoot}]
\beginverse
\[G] If you could read my mind love, \[F] what a tale my thoughts could tell
\[G] Just like an old time movie \[F] 'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
\[G] In a castle dark or a \[C]fortress strong 
With \[D]chains upon my feet\[Em]  
You \[C]know that ghost is me\[G] 
And \[C]I will never \[G/B]be set free  
As \[Am7]long as I'm a \[D]ghost that you can't \[G]see
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G] If I could read your mind love, \[F] what a tale your thoughts could tell
\[G] Just like a paperback novel, \[F] the kind that drugstores sell
\[G] When you reach the part where the \[C]heartaches come
The \[D]hero would be me\[Em] 
But \[C]heroes often \[G]fail
And \[C]you won't read that \[G/B]book again
Be\[Am7]cause the ending's \[D]just too hard to \[G]take
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G] I'd walk away like a mo\[C]vie star	
Who gets \[D]burned in a three way script\[Em]
\[C]Enter number \[G]two
A \[C]movie queen to \[G/B]play the scene
Of \[Am7]bringing all the \[D]good things out in \[G]me

But for \[C]now love, let's be \[G/B]real
I ne\[C]ver thought I could \[G/B]act this way 
And I've \[Am7]got to say that I \[D]just don't get it
\[C]I don't know where \[G/B]we went wrong
But the \[Am7]feelin's gone
And I \[D]just can't get it \[G]back
\endverse

\[G] If you could read my mind love, \[F] what a tale my thoughts could tell
\[G] Just like an old time movie \[F] 'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
\[G] In a castle dark or a \[C]fortress strong
With \[D]chains upon my \[Em]feet 
But \[C]stories always \[G]end
And \[C]if you read be\[G/B]tween the lines
You'll \[Am7]know that I'm just \[D]tryin' to under\[G]stand

The \[C]feelin's that you \[G/B]lack
I \[C]never thought I could \[G/B]feel this way
And I've \[Am7]got to say that I \[D]just don't get it
\[C]I don't know where \[G/B]we went wrong
But the \[Am7]feelin's gone
And I \[D]just can't get it \[G]back
