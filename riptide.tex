\beginverse\memorize
\[Am]I was scared of \[G]dentists and the \[C]dark
\[Am]I was scared of \[G]pretty girls and \[C]starting conversations
Oh, \[Am]all my \[G]friends are turning \[C]green
You're the \[Am]magician's ass\[G]istant in their \[C]dream

\[Am]Oh-\[G]-oooh,\[C]ooh. \[Am]Ooh \[G]ooh and they \[C]come unstuck
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Am]Lady, \[G]running down to the \[C]riptide
\[C]Taken away to the \[Am]dark side
\[G]I wanna be your \[C]left hand man
I \[Am]love you \[G]when you're singing that \[C]song and
\[C]I got a lump in my \[Am]throat 'cause
\[G]You're gonna sing the \[C]words wrong
\endchorus
\beginverse
^Thereâ€™s this movie ^that I think you'll ^like
This ^guy decides to ^quit his job and ^heads to New York City
This ^cowboy's ^running from him^self
And ^she's been living ^on the highest ^shelf

^Oh-^oooh, ^ooh. ^Ooh ^ooh and they ^come unstuck

\[Am]I just wanna, I just wanna \[G]know
\[C]If you're gonna, if you're gonna \[F]stay
\[Am]I just gotta, I just gotta \[G]know
\[C]I can't have it, I can't have it \[F]any other way
I \[Am]swear she's \[G]destined for the \[C]screen
\[Am]Closest thing to \[G]Michelle Pfeiffer \[C]that you've ever seen, oh
