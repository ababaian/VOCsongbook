\beginsong{Piano man}[by={Billy Joel}]
\beginverse
It's \[C]nine o'\[G]clock on a \[F]Satur\[C]day, the \[F]regular \[C]crowd shuffles \[D7]\[G]in
There's an \[C]old man \[G]sitting \[F]next to \[C]me making \[F]love to his \[G]tonic and \[C]gin\[G]

He says, \[C]"Son, can you \[G]play me a \[F]memo\[C]ry, I'm \[F]not really \[C]sure how it \[D7]goes\[G]
But it's \[C]sad and it's \[G]sweet and I \[F]knew it com\[C]plete
When \[F]I wore a \[G]younger man's \[C]clothes."
\[Am]la la la, di da \[D7]da \[Am]La la, di di \[D7]da da \[G]dum\[F]\[C]\[G7]
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]Sing us a \[G]song, you're the \[F]piano \[C]man. \[F]Sing us a \[C]song to\[D7]night\[G]
Well, we're \[C]all in the \[G]mood for a \[F]melody\[C] 
And \[F]you've got us all \[G]feeling al\[C]right\[G]
\endchorus

\beginverse
Now \[C]John at the \[G]bar is a \[F]friend of \[C]mine. He \[F]gets me my \[C]drinks for \[D7]free\[G]
And he's \[C]quick with a \[G]joke or to \[F]light up your \[C]smoke 
but there's \[F]some place that \[G]he'd rather \[C]be\[G]

He says, \[C]"Bill, I \[G]believe this is \[F]killing \[C]me."
As the \[F]smile ran \[C]away from his \[D7]\[G]face
"Well I'm \[C]sure that I \[G]could be a \[F]movie \[C]star
If \[F]I could get \[G]out of this \[C]place"
\[Am]la la la, di da \[D7]da \[Am]La la, di di \[D7]da da \[G]dum\[F]\[C]\[G7]
\endverse

\beginverse
Now \[C]Paul is a \[G]real estate \[F]novelist\[C] who \[F]never had \[C]time for a \[D7]wife\[G]
And he's \[C]talking with \[G]Davy, who's \[F]still in the \[C]Navy
And \[F]probably will \[G]be for \[C]life\[G]

And the \[C]waitress is \[G]practicing \[F]politics\[C]
As the \[F]businessman \[C]slowly gets \[D7]stoned\[G]
Yes, they're \[C]sharing a \[G]drink they call \[F]loneliness\[C]
But it's \[F]better than \[G]drinking \[C]alone\[G]
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus}

\beginverse
It's a \[C]pretty good \[G]crowd for a \[F]Saturday\[C]
And the \[F]manager \[C]gives me a \[D7]smile\[G]
'Cause he \[C]knows that it's \[G]me they've been \[F]coming to \[C]see
To \[F]forget about \[G]life for a \[C]while\[G]

And the \[C]piano, it \[G]sounds like a \[F]carnival\[C]
And the \[F]microphone \[C]smells like a \[D7]beer\[G]
And they \[C]sit at the \[G]bar and put\[F] bread in my \[C]jar
And say, \[F]"Man, what are \[G]you doing \[C]here?"\[G]
\[Am]la la la, di da \[D7]da \[Am]La la, di di \[D7]da da \[G]dum\[F]\[C]\[G7]
