I met my \[G]love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a \[C]dream by the old ca\[G]nal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old \[D]town, Dirty old \[Em]town

Clouds a \[G]drifting across the moon
Cats a \[C]prowling on their \[G]beats
Spring's a girl on the street at night

Heard a \[G]siren from the docks
Saw a \[C]train set the night on \[G]fire
Smelled the spring on the smokey wind
Dirty old \[D]town, Dirty old \[Em]town
\endverse
\beginverse*
I'm going to \[G]make me a good sharp axe
Shining \[C]steel tempered in the \[G]fire
Iâ€™ll chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old \[D]town, Dirty old \[Em]town

I met my \[G]love by the gas works wall

I kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old \[D]town, Dirty old \[Em]town
Dirty old \[D]town, Dirty old \[Em]town
