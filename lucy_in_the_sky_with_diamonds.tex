A \[A]girl with \[A/G]kaleidoscope \[A/F\#]eyes \[Dm] \[F]

And she's \[D]gone

\beginverse*
\[A]Follow her \[A/G]down to a \[A/F\#]bridge by a \[A/F]fountain
Where \[A]rocking horse \[A/G]people \[A/F\#]eat marshmallow \[F]pies
\[A]Everyone \[A/G]smiles as you drift past the \[A/F]flowers
That \[A]grow so \[A/G]incredibly \[F]high

\[F]Waiting to take you \[Bb]away
\[C]Climb in the back with your \[G]head in the clouds
And you're \[D]gone
