When the \[G]night has come
\[Em] And the land is dark
And the \[C]moon is the \[D]only light we'll\[G] see

If the \[G]sky, that we look upon
\[Em] Should tumble and fall
Or the \[C]mountain should \[D]crumble to the \[G]sea
I won't \[G]cry, I won't cry
No, I \[Em]won't shed a tear
Just as \[C]long as you \[D]stand, stand by \[G] me
