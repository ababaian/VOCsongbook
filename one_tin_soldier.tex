\beginsong{One tin soldier}[by={The Original Caste}]

\beginverse
\[C]Listen children \[G]to a story \[Am]that was written \[Em]long ago	   					
\[F]'Bout a kingdom on \[C]a mountain, and the \[F]valley folk bel\[G]ow
\[C]On the mountain \[G]was a treasure \[Am]buried deep be\[Em]neath a stone
\[F]And the valley \[C]people swore they'd \[F]have it for their very \[C]own.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]Go ahead and hate your \[Em]neighbor, \[F]go ahead and cheat a \[C]friend
\[C]Do it in the name of \[Em]heaven, \[F]justify it in the \[C]end
\[C]There won't be any trumpets \[Em]blowing, \[F]come the judgment \[C]day		
\[no chord]On the bloody morning after - \[F]one tin soldier rides \[C]away.
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[C]So the people \[G]of the valley \[Am]sent a message \[Em]up the hill
\[F]Asking for the \[C]buried treasure, \[F]tons of gold for which they'd \[G]kill
\[C]Came an answer \[G]from the kingdom: “\[Am]With our brothers \[Em]we will share
\[F]All the secrets \[C]of our mountain, \[F]all the riches \[C]buried there.
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
\[C]Now the valley \[G]cried with anger, \[Am]mount your horses, \[Em]draw your sword!
\[F]And they killed the \[C]mountain people, \[F]sure they’d won their just \[G]reward
\[C]Now they stood \[G]beside the treasure \[Am]on the mountain \[Em]dark and red
\[F]Turned the stone and \[C]looked beneath it - 
\[F]"Peace on Earth" was \[C]all it said. \textbf{(Repeat Chorus x 2)}
