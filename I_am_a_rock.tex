\beginsong{I am a rock}[by={Simon and Garfunkel}]
\capo{5}
\beginverse\memorize
A winter's \[G]day in a \[C]deep and dark De\[G]cember;
\[Am] I \[D]am a\[C]lo\[G]ne,
\[Am]Gazing from my \[Bm]window \[Am]to the streets be\[Bm]low
On a \[Am]freshly fallen \[C]silent shroud of \[D]snow.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]I am a \[G]rock,
\[C]I am an \[D]is\[G]land.
\endchorus

\beginverse
I've built ^walls, a ^fortress steep and ^mighty,
That ^none ^may ^pene^trate.
I ^have no need of ^friendship; ^friendship causes ^pain.
It's ^laughter and it's ^loving I dis^dain.
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus}

\beginverse
Don't talk of ^love, well I've ^heard the word be^fore;
It's ^slee^ping in my ^memo^ry.
I ^won't disturb the ^slumber of ^feelings that have ^died.
If I ^never loved I ^never would have ^cried.
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus}

\beginverse
I have my ^books and my ^poetry to pro^tect me;
I am ^shiel-^ded in my ^ar^mor,
^Hiding in my ^room, ^safe within my ^womb.
I ^touch no one and ^no one touches ^me.
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus (without Em chord) }
\beginverse*
And a \[C]rock \[D]feels no \[G]pain;
And an \[C]island \[D]never \[G]cries.
\endverse
