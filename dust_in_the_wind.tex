\beginverse*
^Same ^old ^song, 
^just a drop of ^water in an ^endless sea 
^ ^All ^we ^do,
^crumbles to the ^ground, though we ^refuse to see

^ Du--^--st in the ^wind, 
^All we are is ^dust in the wind
\endverse
\beginverse*
^Don't ^hang ^on, 
^nothing lasts for^ever but the ^earth and sky 
^ It ^slips ^a-^way, 
^all your money ^won't another ^minute buy

^ Du--^--st in the ^wind, 
^All we are is ^dust in the ^wind
