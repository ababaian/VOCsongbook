\beginsong{Whiskey In The Jar}[by={The Dubliners}]
\beginverse*
As \[C]I was goin' over the \[Am]far fam'd Kerry mountains
I \[F]met with Captain Farrell and his \[C]money he was \[G]countin'
I \[C]first produced my pistol and \[Am]then produced my rapier
I said \[F]stand and deliver or the \[C]devil he may take ya
\endverse
\beginchorus
Musha \[G]ring dum a doo dum a da
\[C] Whack for my daddy ol'
\[F]  Whack for my daddy ol'
There's \[C]whiskey \[G]in the \[C]jar.
\endchorus

\beginverse*
I ^counted out his money and it ^made a pretty penny
I ^put it in me pocket and I ^took it home to Jenny
She ^sighed and she swore that she ^never would deceive me
But the ^devil take the women for they ^never can be easy
\endverse

\textnote{Chorus}

\beginverse*
I ^went up to my chamber, all ^for to take a slumber
I ^dreamt of gold and jewels and for ^sure 't was no wonder
But ^Jenny drew me charges and she ^filled them up with water
Then ^sent for captain Farrell to be ^ready for the slaughter
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
't was ^early in the morning, just be^fore I rose to travel
Up ^comes a band of footmen and ^likewise captain Farrell
I ^first produced me pistol for she ^stole away me rapier
I ^couldn't shoot the water, so a ^prisoner I was taken
\endverse

\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
Now ^there's some take delight in the ^carriages a rolling
and ^others take delight in the ^hurling and the bowling
but ^I take delight in the ^juice of the barley
and ^courting pretty fair maids in the ^morning bright and early
\endverse

\textnote{Chorus}

\beginverse*
If ^anyone can aid me 't is my ^brother in the army
If ^I can find his station in ^Cork or in Killarney
And ^if he'll go with me, we'll go ^rovin' through Killkenny
And I'm ^sure he'll treat me better than my ^own a-sporting Jenny
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
