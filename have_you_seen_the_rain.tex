\[C] Someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm

I \[G7]know, shinin' down like \[C]water

\[F] I wanna \[G7]know, have you \[C]ever \[Em]seen the \[Am]rain

\[C] Yesterday and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard

'Til forever, on it goes through the circle, fast and slow
I \[G7]know, it can't stop, I \[C]wonder
