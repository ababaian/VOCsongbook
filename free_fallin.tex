\beginsong{Free Falling}[by={Tom Petty}]
\beginverse (**CHORDS TO BE INSERTED)
She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
\endverse
\beginverse 
It's a long day livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
I'm a bad boy, 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart
\endverse
\beginchorus
And I'm free, I'm free fallin'
\endchorus
\beginverse
All the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Blvd
All the bad boys are standing in the shadows
All the good girls are home with broken hearts
\endverse
\beginchorus
And I'm free, I'm free fallin'
\endchorus
\beginverse
I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky
I wanna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while
\endverse
\beginchorus
And I'm free, I'm free fallin'
\endchorus
