\textnote{(Note: if D/Fsharp is difficult, regular D sounds fine)}
\beginverse*
\[Bm] On a dark desert highway,\[F#] cool wind in my hair
\[A] Warm smell of colitas,\[E] rising up through the air 
\[G] Up ahead in the distance, \[D/F#] I saw a shimmering light 
\[Em] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
\[F#] I had to stop for the night 
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[Bm] There she stood in the doorway\[F#] I heard the mission bell 
\[A] And I was thinking to myself, 'This could be
\[E]Heaven or this could be Hell' 
\[G] Then she lit up a candle,\[D/F#] and she showed me the way 
\[Em] There were voices down the corridor, 
\[F#] I thought I heard them say... 
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G] Welcome to the Hotel Califo\[D/F#]rnia
Such a \[F#]lovely place (such a lovely place) 
Such a \[Bm]lovely face (such a lovely face)
\[G]Plenty of room at the Hotel Califo\[D/F]rnia 
Any \[Em]time of year (any time of year) 
You can \[F#]find it here 
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Bm] Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,\[F#] she got the Mercedes benz
\[A] She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,\[E] that she calls friends 
\[G] How they dance in the courtyard, \[D/F#]sweet summer sweat. 
\[Em] Some dance to remember, \[F#] some dance to forget
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[Bm] So I called up the Captain,\[F#] 'Please bring me my wine' 
He said, \[A] 'We haven't had that spirit here since\[E] 1969' 
\[G] And still those voices are calling from \[D/F#]far away, 
\[Em] Wake you up in the middle of the night 
\[F#] Just to hear them say... 
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G] Welcome to the Hotel Califo\[D/F#]rnia
Such a \[F#]lovely place (such a lovely place) 
Such a \[Bm]lovely face (such a lovely face)
They're \[G]living it up at the Hotel Califo\[D/F#]rnia                    
What a \[Em]nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your \[F#]alibis (bring your alibis)
\endchorus
\beginverse*
\[Bm] Mirrors on the ceiling,\[F#] the pink champagne on ice,
And she said\[A] 'We are all just prisoners here,\[E] of our own device' 
\[G] And in the master's chambers,\[D/F#] they gathered for the feast 
\[Em] They stab it with their steely knives, but they
\[F#]just can't kill the beast 
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[Bm] Last thing I remember, I was\[F#] running for the door 
\[A] I had to find the passage back to the \[E]place I was before 
\[G] 'Relax' said the night man. We are\[D/F#] programmed to receive. 
\[Em] You can check out any time you like, 
\[F#] but you can never leave
\endverse
