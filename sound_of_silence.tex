\beginsong{Sound Of Silence}[by={Simon And Garfunkel}]
\beginverse*
\[Am] Hello darkness, my old \[G]friend
I've come to talk with you a\[Am]gain
Because a \[C]vision softl\[F]y cree\[C]ping
Left its seeds while I wa\[F]s slee\[C]ping
And the \[F]vision that was planted
In my \[C]brain still remains \[Am]
\[C] Within the \[G]sound of \[Am]silence
\endverse
\beginverse*
In restless dreams I walked a\[G]lone
Narrow streets of cobble\[Am]stone
'Neath the \[C]halo of a\[F] street \[C]lamp
I turned my collar to the \[F]cold and \[C]damp
When my \[F]eyes were stabbed by the flash of
A neon \[C]light that split the night \[Am]
\[C] And touched the \[G]sound of \[Am]silence
\endverse
\beginverse*
And in the naked light I \[G]saw
Ten thousand people, maybe \[Am]more
People talking with\[F]out spea\[C]king
People hearing with\[F]out liste\[C]ning
People writing \[F]songs that voices never \[C]share and no one dared \[Am]
\[C] Disturb the \[G]sound of \[Am]silence
\endverse
\beginverse*
Fools said I, you do not \[G]know
Silence like a cancer \[Am]grows
Hear my \[C]words that I \[F]might teach \[C]you
Take my arms that I \[F]might reach \[C]you
But my \[F]words like silent raindrops \[C]fell \[Am]
And e\[C]choed in the \[G]wells of \[Am]silence
\endverse
\beginverse*
And the people bowed and \[G]prayed
To the neon God they \[Am]made
And the \[C]sign flashed out \[F]its war\[C]ning
In the words that it wa\[F]s for\[C]ming
And the signs said, 'The \[F]words of the prophets
Are written on the subway \[C]walls and tenement halls' \[Am]
And \[C]whispered in the \[G]sounds of \[Am]silence
\endverse
