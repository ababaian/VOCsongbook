\textit{(Spoof of California Dreaming)}
\beginverse*
All the holds are wet,
and the sky is gray.
I've been for a climb,
on a shoulder season day.
I'd by stoked and warm,
If I went to Skaha.
Okanagan Dreaming,
On a shoulderseason day.
\endverse
\beginverse*
Stopped into the Bluffs,
I passed them long the way.
Oh I got out all my gear,
and started to belay.
You know the skiers like snow,
they hope it's gonna stay.
Okanagan Dreaming,
On a shoulderseason day.

\beginverse*
All the holds are wet,
and the sky is gray.
I've been for a climb,
on a shoulder season day.
If I was a dirtbag,
I could leave today.
Okanagan Dreaming,
On a shoulderseason day.
