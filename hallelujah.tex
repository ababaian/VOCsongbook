\beginsong{Hallelujah}[by={Leonard Cohen (abridged version)}]
\beginverse*
I've \[C]heard there was a \[Am]secret chord
That \[C]David played, and it \[Am]pleased the Lord
But \[F]you don't really \[G]care for music, \[C]do ya? \[G]
It \[C]goes like this, the \[F]fourth, the \[G]fifth
The \[Am]minor fall, the \[F]major lift
The \[G]baffled king com\[Em]posing Halle\[Am]lujah
\endverse
\beginchorus
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[Am]lujah
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]lu--\[G]--\[C]jah \[G]
\endchorus

\beginverse*
Your \[C]faith was strong but you \[Am]needed proof
You \[C]saw her bathing \[Am]on the roof
Her \[F]beauty in the \[G]moonlight over\[C]threw ya \[G]
She \[C]tied you to a \[F]kitchen \[G]chair
She \[Am]broke your throne, and she \[F]cut your hair
And \[G]from your lips she \[Em]drew the Halle\[Am]lujah
\endverse
\beginchorus
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[Am]lujah
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]lu--\[G]--\[C]jah \[G]
\endchorus
\beginverse*
You \[C]say I took the \[Am]name in vain
I \[C]don't even \[Am]know the name
But \[F]if I did, well, \[G]really, what's it \[C]to ya? \[G]
There's a \[C]blaze of light in \[F]every \[G]word
It \[Am]doesn't matter \[F]which you heard
The \[G]holy or the \[Em]broken Halle\[Am]lujah
\endverse
\beginchorus
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[Am]lujah
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]lu--\[G]--\[C]jah \[G]
\endchorus

\beginverse*
I \[C]did my best, it \[Am]wasn't much
I \[C]couldn't feel, so I \[Am]tried to touch
I've \[F]told the truth, I \[G]didn't come to \[C]fool ya \[G]
And \[C]even though it \[F]all went \[G]wrong
I'll \[Am]stand before the \[F]Lord of Song
With \[G]nothing on my \[Em]tongue but Halle\[Am]lujah
\endverse
\beginchorus
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[Am]lujah
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]lu--\[G]--\[C]jah
\endchorus
