\[Em]Today is \[G]gonna be the day
That they're \[D]gonna throw it back to \[A7]you
\[Em]By now you \[G]should've somehow

\[D]Feels the way I \[A7]do 
About you \[Em]now \[G] \[D] \[A7]
\endverse

\[Em]Back beat, the \[G]word is on the street
That the \[D]fire in your heart is \[A7]out
\[Em]I'm sure you've \[G]heard it all before
But you \[D]never really had a \[A7]doubt
\[Em]I don't believe that \[G]anybody
\[D]Feels the way I \[A7]do about you \[Em]now \[G] \[D] \[A7]
\endverse
\beginverse*
And \[C]all the roads we \[D]have to walk are \[Em]winding
And \[C]all the lights that \[D]lead us there are \[Em]blinding
\[C]There are many \[D]things that I would
\[G]Like to say to \[Em]you
But I don't know \[A7]how
\endverse

And \[Em]after \[C]all \[Em] \[G]
You're my \[Em]wonder\[C]wall \[Em] \[G] \[Em]
