\beginsong{Leaving on a jet plane}[by={John Denver}]
\beginverse\memorize
All my \[G]bags are packed, I'm \[C]ready to go, 
I'm \[G]standing here out\[C]side your door,
I \[G]hate to wake you \[C]up to say good-\[D7]bye.
But the \[G]dawn is breaking, it's \[C]early morn, 
the \[G]taxi's waiting, he's \[C]blowing his horn.
Al\[G]ready I'm so \[C]lonesome I could \[D7]die.
\endverse
\beginchorus
So \[G]kiss me and \[C]smile for me, \[G]tell me that you'll \[C]wait for me, 
\[G]hold me like you'll \[Am]never let me \[D7]go.
'Cause I'm \[G]leaving \[C]on a jet plane, \[G] don't know when \[C]I'll be back again. 
\[G] Oh, \[C]babe, I hate to \[D7]go.
\endchorus
\beginverse
There's so ^many times I've ^let you down, 
so ^many times I've ^played around,
I ^tell you now ^they don't mean a ^thing.
Every ^place I go I'll ^think of you, 
every ^song I sing I'll ^sing for you,
when ^I come back, I'll ^bring your wedding ^ring.
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus}
\beginverse
^Now the time has ^come to leave you, 
^one more time ^let me kiss you,
then ^close your eyes, ^I'll be on my ^way.
^Dream about the ^days to come 
when ^I won't have to ^leave alone,
a^bout the times ^I won't have to ^say:
\endverse
\textnote{Repeat Chorus, then repeat its last two lines}
