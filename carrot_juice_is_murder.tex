\beginsong{Carrot juice is murder}[by={The Arrogant Worms}]
\capo{2 (optional)}
\beginverse  
\[G]Listen up \[D]brothers and \[Em]sisters, \[C]come hear my desper\[D]ate \[G]tale             
I \[G]speak of our \[D]friends of \[Em]nature, \[C]trapped in the \[D]dirt like a \[G]jail
\[G]Vegetables \[D]live in oppre\[Em]ssion, \[C]served on our tables \[D]each \[G]night
This \[G]killing of \[D]veggies is \[Em]madness, \[C]I say we \[D]take up the \[G]fight
\[D]Salads are only for \[G]murderers, \[D]cole slaw's a fascist reg\[G]ime
\[D]Don't think that they don't have \[G]feelings, \[C]just 'cause a radish can't \[D]scream
\endverse

\beginchorus                                               
\[G]I've heard the \[D]screams of the \[Em]vegetables, \[C]watching their skins being \[D]peeled                                
\[G]Grated and \[D]steamed with no \[Em]mercy, h\[C]ow do you t\[D]hink that f\[G]eels?                                                  
\[G]Carrot juice \[D]constitutes \[Em]murder, g\[C]reenhouses prisons for s\[D]laves                    
It's ti\[G]me to stop \[D]all this \[Em]gardening, l\[C]et's call a s\[D]pade a s\[G]pade
\endchorus 
 
\beginverse                       
\[G]I saw a man \[D]eating \[Em]celery, \[C]so I beat him blac\[D]k and bl\[G]ue                               
If \[G]he ever \[D]touches a \[Em]sprout again, I'll \[C]bite him \[D]clean in \[G]two               
\[G]I'm a po\[D]litical \[Em]prisoner, \[C]trapped in a window\[D]less \[G]cage                 
\[G]'cause I stopped the \[D]slaughter of \[Em]turnips, by \[C]killing five \[D]men in a \[G]rage
\[D]I told the judge when he \[G]sentenced me, \[D]this is my finest \[G]hour
\[D]I'd kill those farmers \[G]again, \[C]just to save one more caul\[D]iflower
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus} 
 
\textnote{Bridge:}
\beginverse*
\[Am]How low as people do \[Em]we dare to stoop                
\[C]Making young broccolis \[G]bleed in the soup
\[Am]Untie your beans, un\[Em]cage your tomatoes
Let \[C]potted plants free, don't \[D]mash that potato!
\endverse
 
\textnote{Outro:}
\beginverse*
\[G]I've heard the \[D]screams of the \[Em]vegetables, \[C]watching their skins being \[D]peeled
\[G]Grated and \[D]steamed with no \[Em]mercy, h\[C]ow do you t\[D]hink that f\[G]eels?
\[G]Carrot juice \[D]constitutes \[Em]murder, g\[C]reenhouses prisons for s\[D]laves
It's ti\[G]me to stop \[D]all this \[Em]gardening, l\[C]et's call a s\[D]pade a s\[G]pade.
