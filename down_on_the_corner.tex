\beginsong{Down on the Corner}[by={Creedence Clearwater Revival}]
\beginverse
\[C]Early in the evenin' \[G]just about supper \[C]time,
\[C]over by the courthouse, they're \[G]starting to unw\[C]ind,
\[F]four kids on the corner, \[C]trying to bring you up,
\[C]Willy picks a tune out and he \[G]blows it on the \[C]harp.
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F]Down on the \[C]corner, \[G]out in the \[C]stret,
\[C]Willy and the \[F]Poorboys are \[C]playin'
bring a \[G]nickel, tap your \[C]feet.
\endchorus
\beginverse
^Rooster hits the washboard, and ^people just gotta ^smile,
^Blinky thumps the gut bass and ^solos for a ^while.
^Poor-boy twangs the rhythm out ^on his Kalamazoo.
And ^Willy goes in to a dance and ^doubles on Kaz^oo.
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse
^You don't need a penny ^just to hang ar^ound,
but ^if you got a nickel won't you ^lay your money ^down.
^Over on the corner, ^there's a happy noise,
^people come from all around to ^watch the magic ^boy.
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus x2}
