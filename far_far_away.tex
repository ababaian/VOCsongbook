\beginverse\memorize
I've seen the \[Am]yellow lights go \[G]down the Mississ\[Am]ippi \[G]
I've seen the \[Am]bridges of the \[G]world and they're for \[Am]real \[G]
I've had a \[F]red light of the \[G]wrist 
Without me \[C]even gettin' \[Am]kissed 
It \[F]still seems \[Dm]so un\[G]real.
\endverse

\beginverse
I've seen the ^morning in the ^mountains of Al^aska ^
I've seen the ^sunset in the ^east and in the ^west ^
I've sang the ^glory that was ^Rome,
And passed the ^hound dog singer's ^home;
It ^still seems ^for the ^best.
\endverse

\beginchorus
And I'm \[C]far, \[G]far \[Am]away \[Em7]
with my \[F]head up \[Dm]in the \[G]clouds
And I'm \[C]far, \[G]far \[Am]away \[Em7]
With my \[F]feet down \[Dm]in the \[G]crowds
\echo{Lettin' \[C]loose \[G]around the \[Am]world \[Em]
But the \[F]call of \[Dm]home is \[E]loud, still as \[Am]loud \[G]}
{\nolyrics \[Am] \[G] (x 3)}
\endchorus

\beginverse
I've seen the ^Paris lights from ^high upon Mont^martre ^
And felt the ^silence hanging ^low in no-man's ^land; ^
And all those ^Spanish nights were ^fine,
It wasn't ^only from the ^wine;
It ^still seems ^all in ^hand.
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus}

\beginverse
I've seen the ^yellow lights go ^down the Mississ^ippi ^
The grand Ba^hama's islands' ^stories carry ^on; ^
And all those ^arigato ^smiles
Stay in your ^memory for a ^while;
There ^still seems ^more to ^come.

And I'm \[C]far, \[G]far a\[Am]way \[Em]
But the \[F]sound of \[Dm]home is \[E]loud still as \[Am]loud. \[G]
