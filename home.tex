Him: Jade \textit{Her: Alexander}
Do you remember that day you fell outta my window?
\textit{ I sure do, you came jumping out after me.}
Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass, you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that? \textit{Yes I do.}
Well there's something I never told you about that night.
\textit{ What didn't you tell me?}
While you were sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you til just now.
