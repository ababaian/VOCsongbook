\beginsong{Scarborough Fair}[by={Simon and Garfunkel}]
\beginchorus
\[Em]Are you goin' to \[D]Scar\[Ds4]boro\[D]ugh \[Em]Fair?
\[G]Parsley, \[Em]sage, rose\[G]ma\[A]ry, and \[Em]thyme
\[Em]Remember \[G]me to one who lives \[D]there \[Ds4] \[D] \[Ds4] \[D]
\[Em]She once \[D]was a true love of \[Em]mine
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Em]Tell her to make me a \[D]ca\[Ds4]mbr\[D]ic \[Em]shirt
(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
\[G]Parsley, \[Em]sage, rose\[G]ma\[A]ry, and \[Em]thyme
(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)
\[Em]Without no \[G]seams nor needle\[D]work \[Ds4] \[D] \[Ds4] \[D]
(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
\[Em]Then she'll \[D]be a true love of \[Em]mine (Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Em]Tell her to find me an \[D]ac\[Ds4]re \[D]of \[Em]land
\[G]Parsley, \[Em]sage, rose\[G]ma\[A]ry, and \[Em]thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
\[Em]Between the salt \[G]water and the sea \[D]strands \[Ds4] \[D] \[Ds4] \[D]
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
\[Em]Then she'll \[D]be a true love of \[Em]mine
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Em]Tell her to reap it in a \[D]si\[Ds4]ckle\[D] of \[Em]leather
(War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)
\[G]Parsley, \[Em]sage, rose\[G]ma\[A]ry, and \[Em]thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And \[Em]gather it \[G]all in a bunch of \[D]heather \[Ds4] \[D] \[Ds4] \[D]
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
\[Em]Then she'll \[D]be a true love of \[Em]mine
\endverse
