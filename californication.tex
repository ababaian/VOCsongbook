\beginsong{Californication}[by={Red Hot Chili Peppers}]
\beginverse\memorize
\[Am]Psychic spies from China
Try to \[F]steal your mind's elation
\[Am]Little girls from Sweden
Dream of \[F]silver screen quotations
And \[C]if you want these \[G]kind of dreams
It's \[F]Californi\[Dm]cation
\endverse
\beginverse*
It's the ^ edge of the world
And all of ^western civilization
The ^sun may rise in the East
At least it ^settles in the final location
It's ^understood that ^Hollywood
Sells ^Californi^cation
\endverse
\beginverse*
^Pay your surgeon very well
To ^break the spell of aging
Ce^lebrity skin is this your chin
Or is ^that war your waging
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Am] First born uni\[F]corn
\[Am] Hard core soft \[F]porn
\[C]Dream of Cali\[G]forni\[Dm]cation \[Am]
\[C]Dream of Cali\[G]forni\[Dm]cation
\endchorus
\beginverse*
^Marry me girl be my fairy to the world
Be my ^very own constellation
A ^teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting ^high on information
And ^buy me a star on the ^boulevard
It's ^Californi^cation
\endverse
\beginverse*
^Space may be the final frontier
But it's ^made in a Hollywood basement
^Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing ^songs off station to station
And ^Alderon's not ^far away
It's ^Californi^cation
\endverse
\beginverse*
^Born and raised by those who praise
Con^trol of population 
^Everybody's been there and
I ^don't mean on vacation
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
\beginverse*
^Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it ^also breeds creation
And ^earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're ^just another good vibration
And ^tidal waves couldn't ^save the world
From ^Californi^cation
\endverse
\beginverse*
^Pay your surgeon very well
To ^break the spell of aging
^Sicker than the rest, there is no test
But ^this is what you're craving
\endverse
\textnote{Chorus}
