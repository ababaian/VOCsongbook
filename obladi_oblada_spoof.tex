\beginverse
\[A]Desmond does his faffing at the \[E]parking place
\[E7]Molly does it halfway up the \[A]trail
Desmond says to Molly ``Can we \[D]keep the pace?"
And Molly \[A]says this as she \[E]pauses to ex\[A]hale
\endverse

\beginchorus
(Ob-la-\[A]di, ob-la-da, faff goes \[E]on, \[F#m]brah!
\[A]Lala how the \[E]faff goes \[A]on) (x 2)
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A]Desmond needs a break to put some \[E]sunscreen on
\[E7]To prove he really is the faffing \[A]king
Molly takes her pack off 'cause it \[D]takes so long
And as he \[A]rubs the cream in \[E]she begins to \[A]sing...
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus}

\beginverse
\[D]In a couple of miles, they have stopped to eat a snack \[A] \[A7]
\[D]With a couple of crumbs for the whiskey jacks,
\[A/E]While Desmond and Molly \[E]faff... (Ha ha ha ha ha)
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A]Happy ever after on the \[E]mountain top
\[E7]Desmond takes off layers on a \[A]whim
Molly puts them on and Desmond \[D]has to stop
And in the \[A]evening they go \[E]for a naked \[A]swim
\endverse
