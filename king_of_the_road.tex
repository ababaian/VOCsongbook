\beginsong{King of the road}[by={Roger Miller}]
\capo{1 (optional)}
\beginchorus
\[A] Trailer for \[D]sale or rent, \[E] rooms to let, \[A]fifty cents.
\[A]No phone, no \[D]pool, no pets, \[E] I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but,\[A] two hours of \[D]pushin' broom 
buys an \[E] eight by twelve \[A]four-bit room
I'm a \[A] man of m\[D]eans by no means, \[E] king of the ro\[A]ad.
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[A] Third boxcar, \[D]midnight train, \[E]destination, \[A]Bangor, Maine.
\[A] Old worn out \[D]suit and shoes, \[E] I don't pay no union dues,
I smoke \[A] old stogies \[D]I have found \[E] short but not too \[A]big around
I'm a \[A] man of m\[D]eans by no means, \[E] king of the ro\[A]ad.
\endverse
\textnote{Move capo up 1 fret} - (** WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? WHY NOT TRANSPOSE THE LAST VERSE OR PLAY IN THE SAME KEY?)
\beginverse
I know \[A]every engineer on \[D]every train 
\[E] All of their children, and \[A]all of their names
And every handout in \[D]every town, 
and \[E]every lock that ain't locked, when no one's around.
\endverse
