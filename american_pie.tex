\beginsong{American Pie}[by={Don McLean}]
\beginverse*
A \[G]long, \[D]long \[Em7]time ago
\[Am]I can still re-\[C]member 
how that \[Em]music used to make me \[D]smile
And \[G]I knew \[D]if I \[Em7]had my chance
That \[Am]I could make those \[C]people dance
And \[Em]maybe they'd be \[C]happy for a \[D]while

\[Em] But February made\[Am] me shiver
\[Em] With every paper I'd \[Am] deliver
\[C]Bad news \[G]on the \[Am]doorstep
I \[C]couldn't take one more step \[D]

I \[G]can't remem\[D]ber if I \[Em]cried
When I \[Am7]read about his \[D]widowed bride
\[G]Something \[D]touched me \[Em]deep inside
The \[D]day the \[D7]music \[G]died \[C] \[G]
\endverse*
\beginchorus
So \[G]bye, \[C]bye, Miss Am\[G]erican \[D]Pie
Drove my \[G]Chevy to the \[C]levee, but the \[G]levee was \[D]dry
And them \[G]good old \[C]boys were drinkin' \[G]whiskey and \[D]rye
Singin' \[Em]This'll be the day that I \[A7]die
\[Em]This'll be the day that I \[D7]die
\endchorus
\beginverse\memorize
\[G] Did you write the \[Am]book of love
And do \[C]you have faith in \[Am]god above,
\[Em] if the bible \[D]tells you so?
Now do \[G]you be\[D]lieve in \[Em]rock and roll
Can \[Am7]music save your \[C]mortal soul
And \[Em]can you teach me \[A7] how to dance real slow? \[D]
Well, I \[Em]know that you're in \[D]love with him
'Cause I \[Em]saw you dancin' \[D]in the gym
You \[C]both kicked \[G]off your \[A7]shoes
Man, I \[C]dig those rhythm and \[D7]blues
I was a \[G]lonely \[D]teenage \[Em]broncin' buck
With a \[Am]pink carnation and a \[C]pickup truck
But \[G]I knew \[D]I was \[Em]out of luck
The \[C]day the \[D7]music \[G]died \[C]
\[G] I started singin'

Chorus
\endverse
\beginverse*
Now for ^ten years we've been ^on our own
And ^moss grows fat on a ^rollin' stone
^ But that's not how it ^used to be
When the ^jester ^sang for the ^king and queen
In a ^coat he borrowed ^from James Dean
And a ^voice that ^came from you and ^me

Oh, and ^while the king was ^looking down
The ^jester stole his ^thorny crown
The ^courtroom ^was ad^journed
No ^verdict was re-^turned

And while ^Lenin ^read a ^book on Marx
A ^quartet practiced ^in the park
And ^we sang ^dirges ^in the dark
The ^day the ^music ^died ^
^ We were singin'
\endverse
\beginverse*
^Helter skelter ^in a summer swelter
The ^birds flew off with a ^fallout shelter
^Eight miles high and ^falling fast.
^It landed ^foul ^on the grass
The ^players tried for a ^forward pass
With the ^jester on the ^sidelines in a ^cast

Now the ^halftime air was ^sweet perfume
While the ^sergeants played a ^marching tune
We ^all got^ up to ^dance
Oh, but we ^never got the ^chance

'Cause the ^players ^tried to ^take the field
The ^marching band re^fused to yield
^Do you re^call what ^was revealed
The ^day the ^music ^died? ^
^ We started singing.
\endverse
\beginverse*
Oh, and ^there we were all ^in one place
A ^generation ^lost in space
With ^no time left to ^start again
So come ^on, Jack be ^nimble, ^Jack be quick
^Jack Flash sat on a ^candlestick
'Cause ^fire is the ^devil's only ^friend

Oh, ^and as I watched him ^on the stage
My ^hands were clenched in ^fists of rage
^No angel ^born in ^Hell
Could ^break that Satan's ^spell

And as the ^flames climbed ^high int^o the night
To ^light the sacri^ficial rite
I saw ^Satan ^laughing ^with delight
The ^day the ^music ^died ^ 
^ He was singing
\endverse

{\nolyrics Outro}
I \[G]met a \[D]girl who \[Em]sang the blues
And \[Am]I asked her for some \[C]happy news
But \[Em]she just smiled and \[D]turned away
I \[G]went down \[D]to the \[Em]sacred store
Where I'd \[Am]heard the music \[C]years before
But the \[Em]man there said the \[C]music wouldn't \[D]play

But \[Em]in the streets, \[Am]the children screamed
The \[Em]lovers cried and the \[Am]poets dreamed
But \[C]not a \[G]word was \[Am]spoken
The \[C]church bells all were \[D]broken

And the \[G]three men \[D]I ad\[Em]mire most
The \[Am7]father, \[C]son and the \[D7]holy ghost
\[G]They caught the \[D]last train \[Em]for the coast
The \[Am7]day the \[D7]music \[G]died

\[D7]And they were singin' 

\[G]bye \[C]bye, Miss Am\[G]erican \[D]Pie
Drove my \[G]Chevy to the \[C]levee, but the \[G]levee was \[D]dry
Them \[G]good old \[C]boys were drinkin' \[G]whiskey and \[D]rye
Singin' \[Em]This'll be the day that I \[A7]die
\[Em]This will be the day that I \[D7]die
They were singing
\[G]bye \[C]bye, Miss Am\[G]erican \[D]Pie
Drove my \[G]Chevy to the \[C]levee, but the \[G]levee was \[D]dry
Them \[G]good old \[C]boys were drinkin' \[G]whiskey and \[D]rye
Singin' \[C]This'll be the \[D7]day that I \[G]die \[C] \[G]
