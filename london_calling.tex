\beginverse
\[Em]London calling to the \[F]faraway towns
Now \[G]war is declared, and battle come down
\[Em]London calling to the \[F]underworld
\[G]Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
\[Em]London calling, now \[F]don't look to us
\[G]Phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust
\[Em]London calling, see we \[F]ain't got no swing
\[G]â€™Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing
\endverse 	
\beginchorus
\[Em]The ice age is coming, the \[G]sun's zooming in
\[Em]Meltdown expected, the \[G]wheat is growing thin
\[Em]Engines stop running, but \[G]I have no fear
\[Em]'Cause London is drowning, and \[D]I, I live by the river
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Em]London calling to the \[F]imitation zone
\[G]Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
\[Em]London calling to the \[F]zombies of death
\[G]Quit holding out, and draw another breath
\[Em]London calling, and I \[F]don't wanna shout
But \[G]while we were talking, I saw you nodding out
\[Em]London calling, see we \[F]ain't got no high
\[G]Except for that one with the yellowy eyes
