Hey I was \[D]just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew love before I left my nurser\[A]y
Left al\[D]one with big fat Fanny
She was \[G]such a naughty nanny
Heap big \[D]woman, you made a \[A]bad boy out of \[D]me
Hey hey!
\endverse

\beginverse*
I've been \[D]singing with my band
Across the water, across the land
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the \[A]way (hey)
But their \[D]beauty and their style
Went kind of \[G]smooth after a while
Take me \[D]to them naughty \[A]ladies every \[D]time

C'mon!
